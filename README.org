#+TITLE: TREX I/O prototype library

* Installation
  This prototype uses  the EZFIO library generator,  which is provided
  as a submodule.  EZFIO requires  the IRPF90 code generator, which is
  also provided as a submodule.

  To clone this repository, use:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/TREX-CoE/trex-io-prototype
  #+END_SRC

  then run
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
./configure.sh
  #+END_SRC

  This step has  created the file named  =make.config=, which contains
  the configuration for the Makefiles.aNow edit this file to adapt the
  compiler and options to your computer.

  To modify the configuration of the library, modify the =trex.config=
  file.

  To build the library and the examples, run:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
make
  #+END_SRC

  and the library will be built in the =lib/= directory.

** Important

   To run  the examples,  you need to  set the the  path to  the =lib=
   directory  into your  =LD_LIBRARY_PATH=  environment variable,  for
   instance:

   #+BEGIN_SRC
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${PWD}/lib
   #+END_SRC
   
* Conventions

** General

   - All data is stored in atomic units.
   - All the names are given in singular
   - The =num= suffix  denotes the number. For  example =apple_num= is
     the number of apples

** TODO Atomic orbitals (AOs)

*** TODO Gaussian orbitals

    The AOs can be expressed in spherical or in cartesian coordinates.
    They  are stored  as shells,  and then  the full  AO basis  can be
    expanded  according  to  the  fixed   orders  of  the  the  radial
    functions.

    \[ chi_k(r_k,\theta_k,\phi_k) = \mathcal{N}_k
    Y^k_{lm}(\theta_k,\phi_k)\, \sum_i p_{ik} \exp(-\alpha_{ik} r_k^2)
    \]

    \[ chi_k(x_k,y_k,z_k) = \mathcal{N}_k x_k^a\, y_k^b\, z_k^c\,
    \sum_i p_{ik} \exp(-\alpha_{ik} (x_k^2+y_k^2+z_k^2) ) \]

    where $r_k,  \theta_k, \phi_k$ and  $x_k, y_k, z_k$  are expressed
    with respect to the center of the AO.

    By definition, AOs are centered on nuclei. To enable the centering
    of AOs in  arbitrary positions, one can define dummy  atoms in the
    =nuclei= section.

** TODO Molecular orbitals (MOs)

   The MOs are expanded on the /normalized/ atomic basis set:

   \[ \varphi_i(r) = \sum_k c_{ki} \chi_k(r) \]

* Helper functions
  
** Periodic table

*** =trexio_element_name_of_symbol=
    Returns the name of an element from its symbol

*** =trexio_element_number_of_symbol=
    Returns the atomic number of an element from its symbol

*** =trexio_element_symbol_of_number=
    Returns the symbol of an element from its atomic number

    
** Spherical to cartesian coordinates transformation
   
   The transformation matrix from the  AO basis expressed in spherical
   coordinates to the AO basis  expressed in cartesian coordinates can
   be retrieved, as well as its pseudo-inverse.
